This project uses ARIMA model, dynamic regression model and NNAR model to perform time series analysis on Bitcoin data.
The data from 2019-01-01 to 2023-12-31 was selected as the training set, and the data from 2024-01-01 to 2024-11-07 was selected as the training set.
The results show that the dynamic regression and NNAR models perform better than the ARIMA model, and the dynamic regression model performs slightly better than the NNAR model. 
The residual test shows that the innovation residual of the fitted dynamic regression model is white noise.
